Clean energy is a prosperity strategy. It lowers bills over time, creates local jobs, and cuts pollution that harms health. Bright Green supports policies that speed deployment of affordable renewables, energy storage, and efficiency—without leaving communities behind.

## What we support
- Faster interconnection and permitting for solar, wind, and storage
- Grid upgrades and demand-side programs that reduce peak costs
- Clean transportation: charging networks, e-buses, and e-bikes
- Weatherization and heat-pump incentives that help households and small businesses
- [Add local/state-specific example here]

## Why it matters
Households feel energy costs every month. Spending smarter on efficiency and modern infrastructure reduces those costs while building good jobs. Every dollar we waste on outdated systems is a dollar that could strengthen communities.

## Our approach
We back candidates and measures that make clean energy practical: clear timelines, transparent budgets, accountability for results, and community benefits. Clean energy should be reliable, fair, and built to last. We will highlight leaders who bring measurable progress—so voters can see and feel the difference.
