Clean energy is a prosperity strategy.  It builds a base of long-term generation, lowers bills over time, creates local jobs, and cuts the pollution that harms health and dirties our sky.  Bright Green supports policy outcomes that speed the deployment of affordable renewables, drive innovation to make energy storage affordable, and confront the situation with clarity and optimism.

## What we support
- Faster interconnection and permitting for solar, wind, and storage
- Modern grid upgrades and smart demand-side programs that cut peak costs
- Clean transportation: charging networks and next-generation transit solutions
- Household and small-business savings through weatherization and heat-pump incentives
- Opportunity grants for local innovators and community solutions

## Why it matters
The energy choices we make shape daily life and the future of our economy.  Smarter spending on efficiency and modern infrastructure cuts costs, creates good jobs, and strengthens communities.  Investing in modern energy is how we spark innovation, build resilience, and preserve our health, our environment, and our shared future.

## Our approach
We advance policies and initiatives that make clean energy practical - with clear timelines, transparent budgets, accountability for results, and real community benefits.  Clean energy must endure, protect what we value, and open doors to the future.  Bright Green elevates what works, so clean energy isnâ€™t just a vision but a lived reality.
